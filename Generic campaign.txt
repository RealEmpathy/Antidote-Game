Campaign points
- MC is really good with virology and gentic manipulation and gets recruited by the canadian government to help produce cures for the new diseases of the world
- MC gets brought to CCPC 67-50 (a candian research base) where MC is meant to work
- MC makes some good progress creating cures. the russian civil war is reaching a climax and people around the world are becoming worried about it.
- Canadian government decided to get involved and slowly starts to manipulate MC into making bio-weapons
- As the war continues the Canadian government starts to push MC further and further into making bio-weapons while still keeping the guise that they are still having MC making cures. MC starts to get hints that make them suspicious about the government.
- One of the last points of the game is the government gives MC the ultamatim of either make this the way we want, or youre "done". hopefully this is in as it will result in two different endings. the "good" ending and the "bad" ending.
