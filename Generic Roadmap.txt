ROADMAP

By Nanocon we would like to have:
- A functional simulation
	- Changable attributes
- A main menu desk
- A document people can read while others play describing the key plot points of a potential campaign
- Art assests implemented into the simulation
- A poster with our logo, key game features, and discord link
- A discord server that is mostly set up and ready for the public
- Employee dossiers for people to look at
	- templates of dossiers for people who want to fill out their own for potential character ideas
- Our current government letters printed for people to read
