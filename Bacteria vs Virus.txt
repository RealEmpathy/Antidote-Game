Bacteria vs Virus

All:
Living organisms

Bacteria and Parasites can be killed with anitbiotics, but Viruses can't.
Bacteria and Viruses can live outside a body for hours or days, however Parasites need a host in order to live.
Parasites and Fungi can be both each other and also contain/be Bacteria or Viruses
Viruses weaken your body enough to where even bacteria that are normally harmless can start to make you sick

Infections: Bacteria and Virus
They both spread through
- Coughing and sneezing
- Contact with infected people, especially through kissing and sex
- Contact with contaminated surfaces, food, and water
- Contact with infected creatures, including pets, livestock, and insects such as fleas and ticks

Can both cause: Bacteria and Virus
- Coughing and Sneezing
- Fever
- Inflammation
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Fatigue
- Cramping

Bacteria (aka Prokaryote):
- Relatively complex
- Single celled
- Rigid wall
- Thin rubbery membrane
- Liquid inside cell
- Can reproduce on their own
- Have exsisted for about 3.5 billion years
- Can survive in many different environments
- Most are actually helpful
- Antibiotics
- Can be rod shaped, spherical, sprial shaped, and comma shaped
- Can double in number as often as every 15 mins or as long as a couple of months
- Estimated to be at least one nonillion bacteria on Earth (nonillion contains 30 0's)
- Can survive in environments from extreme heat, to extreme cold and also radioactive wastes
- "Good" bacteria may help fight "Bad" bacteria to prevent them from causing sickness

Three main shapes:
Spherical: simplest to treat, known as Cocci
Rod-Shaped: Bacilli
Spiral: Spirilla. If the coil is particularly tight it is known as Spirochetes

Virus:
- Tinier (largest are still smaller than the tiniest of bacteria)
- Protein coat
- Core of genetic material (either RNA or DNA)
- Can't replicate outside of a host cell
- Can only reproduce by attaching to other cells
- Reprogram cells to make new viruses until the cell dies
- Can also make the cells malignant or cancerous cells
- Most cause diseases
- Specific about the cells they attack
- Vaccines
- Can infect plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and blue green algae
- 5,000 have been identified, but millions are thought to exist.
- Viruses can go into a dormant state and stay that way for a period of time before reactivating

Virus Process:
- enter body
- attatch to cell
- inject genetic code
- code forces cell to replicate
- virus multiplies
- when the infected cell dies, it releases more viruses
- some dont destroy the infected cell, some (like cancer) cause it to replicated in an uncontrolled way

Parasite:
- An organism that requires a host to live and typically causes harm to the host
- Can be a plant, animal, fungus, bacteria, or virus
- Behave like tiny animals
- More common in tropical and subtropical regions
- Three main types that infect humans
	- Protozoa: single celled, live and mulitply in a body
	- Helminths: larger and multi-celled, can live in or out of a body, commonly known as worms
	- Ectoparasites: multi-celled, live on or feed off of skin, includes some insects likes ticks and 		        misquitos
- Can spread through soil, water, food, blood, sexual contact, and bug bites

Fungal:
- Many infections will appear on the upper layers of skin, some progressing to deeper layers.
- If inhaled the spores can lead to systemic infections which can effect the whole body
- Can possibly grow inside a body if enough of the body's "good" bacteria is killed
- Out of millions of different fungal species there are only about 300 that cause sickness
- Newer strains of fungal infections are proving to be especially dangerous, an example of which is Candida aurus which was discovered in 2009

Prion:
- Typically harmless, but can cause havok if it folds into an abnormal shape
- Can affect the stucture of the brain or other parts of the nervous system
- Don't replicate or feed on the host, but trigger abnormal behavior in the cells and proteins
- Rare, but progress rapidly and all known ones are fatal
